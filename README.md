# Basketball Coaching Simulator

Define how your team wants to play. Become the greatest.

## How to play:

You will be coaching a 5v5 basketball team. The problem is your players don't know what to do. That's where your job comes in. You have a coaching panel where you control how your team plays basketball. For example:

* If nobody is in the paint, the biggest man cuts toward the basket.
* If the ball handler is much faster than the defender, drive
* If your player is >= 8 inches taller than their defender, post up
* Much more

## Team Personnel

You will customize your team, in which you will play the entire season with. 
Each player has attributes:
* Speed
* Finishing
* Jump Shooting
* Ball Handling
* Perimiter Defense
* Paint Defense
* Height

You have a certain amount of points that you can spend on your team. Unlike 2K you could give all your attributes to one player on your team and build around that. The choice is yours.
